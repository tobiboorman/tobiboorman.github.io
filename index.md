Welcome to my website! I am a PhD student in Theoretical Condensed Matter Physics at the University of St Andrews working under the 
supervision of <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~bhb/">Dr Bernd Braunecker</a>. My research is currently in the field of strongly correlated materials, specifically, on the novel behaviours that arise due to the joint-coherent evolution of coupled systems at sub-thermal timescales.
<br>
<br>
I'm hoping to use this website as a catalogue of professional and personal projects, as well as to practice the art of website building.
<br>
<br>
I received my 1<sup>st</sup> class MSci (Hons) in Theoretical Physics with Mathematics from Lancaster University in June 2020. In my spare time I enjoy reading, programming, and, as of recently, crochet.
