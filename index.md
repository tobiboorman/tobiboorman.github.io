# About Me
Welcome to my website! I am a PhD student in Theoretical Condensed Matter Physics at the University of St Andrews working under the 
supervision of <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~bhb/">Dr Bernd Braunecker</a>. My research is currently in the field of strongly correlated materials, specifically, on the novel behaviours that arise due to the joint-coherent evolution of coupled systems at sub-thermal timescales.
<br>
<br>
I'm hoping to use this website as a catalogue of professional and personal projects, as well as to practice the art of website building.
<br>
<br>
I received my 1<sup>st</sup> class MSci (Hons) in Theoretical Physics with Mathematics from Lancaster University in June 2020. In my spare time I enjoy reading, programming, and, as of recently, crochet.

# Internship Experience
I have internship experience spanning multiple summer periods, working for high-tech companies in the field of printable electronic sensors and devices. 
My responsibilities were broad, from the fabrication and testing of devices to interactions with potential customers and suppliers. Please visit my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tobias-boorman/">LinkedIn</a> profile for more details.
