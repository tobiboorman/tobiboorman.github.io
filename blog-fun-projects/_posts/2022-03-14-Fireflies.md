Back in November, I found myself curious about spontaneous synchronisation in coupled oscillating systems.
A particularly striking example is the synchronisation of metronomes.

I wanted to see if I could model the onset of spontaneous synchronisation in a more natural setting.
A huge source of inspiration came from the excellent firefly simulation built by [Nicky Case](https://ncase.me/fireflies/).
